# adidas linter configurations

adidas configurations for the different linting tools for JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS/LESS/SASS, etc.

The purpose of these configurations is to define a set of strict rules to validate the coding standards. The adidas standards are based on the most used by the community with some slight changes.

This repository provides configurations for the different JavaScript language versions, from ES5 (which acts as base configuration) to ES9.

These configurations can be used in any project written in JavaScript or TypeScript, it does not matter whether it is frontend or backend code.

## Use cases

The main use case of this repository and their linter configuration is to check the code quality of the source code of the project.

The linter tools used to check these configurations will display errors if a rule is violated but they never modify the source code unless indicated to do so.

adidas is not responsible for the usage of this software for different purposes that the ones described above.

## Requirements and dependencies

This repository contains different linter configuration which are independent packages. It means that all these packages are published independently but managed all together.

[NodeJS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/) are required to work with the repository.

## Installation and running

- In development mode (dependencies of the main package):
    ```shell
    npm ci
    ```
- Install a specific package in production mode (installation of each configuration):
    ```shell
    npm install CONFIGURATION_PACKAGE_NAME[@VERSION]
    ```

The required dependencies of each package are listed in its own `package.json` file as dependency or peer dependency.

Specific instructions about how to run the linter configurations are placed in the `README.md` file of each package.

### ESLint Peer Dependencies

By default, `eslint` resolves dependencies in the first level of `node_modules` and won't go any deeper.

As a fix for this, we improved the resolution by adding `require.resolve` to each `extends` entry in our configurations so it will look for a nested module instead.

Be aware that currently there is no way to resolve either relative or absolute paths for the `plugins` section of ESLint:
